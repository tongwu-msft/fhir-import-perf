Subject: Performance tunning for import operation
 
Hello @Katherine Lightsey (Chameleon Technologies Inc),

     We setup a new environment for performance tests and I added you as owner of this resource group (you might want to add your IP range to the SQL allow list), currently we have 2 test environments:

perfenv1: importperftest - Microsoft Azure
perfenv2: fhirimporttest - Microsoft Azure
 

     And we created E2E performance test scripts here: tongwu-msft/fhir-import-perf (github.com), here’re commands for 2 performance tests against different environment. The sql admin user is fhirAdmin and I would send password separately.

 

  .\FhirImportTest.ps1 -settingsFile .\perfenv1\settings.json
 .\FhirImportTest.ps1 -settingsFile .\perfenv2\settings.json

 

     Please make sure increase SQL cores and App Service instance count before running the tests. And scale down the service to save cost after testing.

Go to App Service Plan(env1: importperf-asp, env2: ) => Scale out => set instance count to 30 => Save => Wait until operation completed.
Go to related SQL database => Pricing Tier => set vCores to 40 => Apply => wait until operation completed.
 

One strange thing we find is there’s big performance gap between 2 environments. We double check the code and inputs are same, SQL and server settings are same. (And we do not found any related difference)

Not sure there’s any manual change for perfenv1 when you did performance tuning last week? The good news is it still can be repro.

 

Here’re the performance number for env1 and env2:

Env1: 21665 resources per second


Env2: 13809 resources per seconds


 

Thanks

Tong
